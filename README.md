# Last.fm API Bindings for Kotlin

The Last.fm API bindings for kotlin are a BSD-licensed wrapper for the [Last.fm api](http://www.last.fm/api) and the Last.fm submission service (scrobbling).

It provides classes and methods to invoke Last.fm API methods as well as scrobbling songs ~~and streaming radio~~ from within Kotlin(JVM) applications.
